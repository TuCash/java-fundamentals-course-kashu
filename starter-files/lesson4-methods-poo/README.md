# Lesson 4 — Methods and OOP

This folder contains a small example that demonstrates:

- How to define and call static methods.
- How to create objects and call instance methods.

Files:

- `Main.java` — contains a `Calculator` class (static `add` and instance `multiply`) and a `main` demonstrating usage.

How to compile and run (PowerShell / Windows):

```powershell
javac Main.java
java Main
```

Expected output (approx.):

```
