# Lesson 5 — OOP basics

This folder contains a small example that demonstrates:

- Defining a simple class with fields and a constructor.
- Implementing instance methods and `toString()`.

Files:

- `Main.java` — contains a `Person` class and a `main` that creates a `Person` and calls `birthday()`.

How to compile and run (PowerShell / Windows):

```powershell
javac Main.java
java Main
```

Expected output (approx.):

```
Lesson 5 — OOP basics: create and interact with objects

Person{name='Ana', age=30}
After birthday: Person{name='Ana', age=31}
```
